# DSFSI NLP Reading Group :books::books:

This repo is based on [Awesome reading group](https://github.com/hadyelsahar/awesome-reading-group This reading group is organized a weekly 60-90 minute meetings once a week. No one is expected prepare slides and/or read the paper in depth. This makes it agile and highly sustainable. For 2020 we will be following the Stanford NLP course. 

Please feel free to give any feedback on current organisation as a new issue to this repository - it can be adapted to our needs.   


  
## :watch: Time and Location 
#### Thursday 4-4:45pm
#### Remote participation:

## TLDR;
   - :heavy_plus_sign: :+1: 
   - :full_moon_with_face: :new_moon_with_face: Everybody is free to attend or not attend; 
   - :memo: Give the video a watch before as much in details, focus on specific parts.  
   - :loudspeaker: At the beginning of the sessions a volunteer does a brief introduction of the video.
   - :speech_balloon: Attendance (usually groups 5-8 participants) can discuss, share impressions, ask questions 
   - :hourglass_flowing_sand: Try to keep it 45 minutes.   
   - :pencil2: take 5 mins to write your reflections on the discussion or add extra thoughts. 

## Detailed Intstructions

**1- Watch the selected paper according to one's time/knowledgeâ€‹**
- The next video to be discussed are added with the discussion date
- You are not supposed to understand everything
- The purpose of the multi-view discussions is to have a discussion with others as different participants will have focused on different parts of the video

**2- Attend the reading group** 
- The main value of such reading/watching groups is in the discussion; even if you didn't understand in depth - everybody pays attention on different things, which are shared during the discussion. Thus, it allows you to cover each topic more than if you would have read it by yourself.  

**3- Sprints** 
 -Sometimes the reading group can go beyond a single paper/video: eg. conference proceedings, several papers around the same subject, etc.  The idea of the sprint is to grasp the as much papers as possible in a short time. We will discuss mechanisms for this.
